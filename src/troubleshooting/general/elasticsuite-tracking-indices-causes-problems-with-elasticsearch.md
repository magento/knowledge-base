This article talks about the issue of Elasticsearch memory problems caused by tracking indices produced by the ElasticSuite plugin.

## Affected products and versions

ElasticSuite versions prior to 2.8.0 are not able to periodically cleanup tracking indices.
ElasticSuite versions prior to 2.9.8 / 2.10.7 are storing tracking indices in daily indices, which causes the number of open indices to grow.

## Issue

If the ElasticSuite third-party plugin is installed, you might experience Elasticsearch memory issues, and the Elasticsearch service might crash caused by ElasticSuite tracking indices. Symptoms include:

* Elasticsearch crashes with no memory errors.
* When running a health command `curl -m1 localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty` or `curl -m1 elasticsearch.internal:9200/_cluster/health?pretty` (for starter accounts) there are hundreds or thousands of `unassigned_shards`
* Elasticsearch or site performance is severely degraded.
* *"No alive nodes found in your cluster"* in Elasticsearch deploy or log errors.
* *"Rejecting mapping update to [<\*>_tracking_log_event_<\*>]"* in deploy or log errors.

## Cause

ElasticSuite has a new feature that creates tracking indices. These tracking indices record which search terms are the most used, which terms generate the most turnover, and which terms are leading to a no results page so merchants can create synonyms to fix them. It does not appear to delete the tracking indices, so Elasticsearch runs out of resources and crashes.

## Solution

### Upgrade your Elasticsuite version to be able to cleanup tracking indices periodically

Once you have upgraded the ElasticSuite plugin to version > 2.8.0, you can configure a periodical cleaning of indices. 

Go to **Stores > Configuration > Tracking > Global Configuration > Retention Delay**

The default retention period is 365 days. You can reduce it to 30 or 15 days.

### Upgrade your Elasticsuite version to use monthly based indices instead of daily based indices

Once you have upgraded the ElasticSuite plugin to version > 2.9.8 / 2.10.7, tracking indices will be monthly based.

You can still reduce the retention period : 

Go to **Stores > Configuration > Tracking > Global Configuration > Retention Delay**

The default retention period is 12 months (will generate 12 indices). You can reduce it to 3 or 6 months.

### Use a cronjob to cleanup tracking indices data

Create a cron job to delete the tracking indices. This command deletes indices created in the last month:

 `curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/<name in index> * **\_tracking\_log** * _$(date
    +'%Y%m' -d 'last month')*`

If you want to delete indices at a set time-frequency, create a cron job by referring to the following articles in our developer documentation:

* [Set up cron jobs](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/configure/setup-cron-jobs.html)

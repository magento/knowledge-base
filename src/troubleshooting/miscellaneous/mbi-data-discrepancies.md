Do the numbers on a certain report look inaccurate? Do you see unexpected NULL values? If you see something that doesn’t seem quite right, we recommend using these resources to help you troubleshoot:

* [Data discrepancy diagnostic checklist](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016731271)
* [Using exports to pinpoint data discrepancies](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016730631)

We also recommend that you ensure the correct [replication methods](https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-analyst/data-warehouse-mgr/cfg-replication-methods.html) and [rechecks](https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-analyst/data-warehouse-mgr/cfg-data-rechecks.html) have been set for the tables and columns involved in the discrepancy. Note that you need Admin permissions to access replication method and recheck information.

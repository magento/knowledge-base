## Issue

<ins>Prerequisites</ins>:

Create a few different products with the same price.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Run the following GraphQL query:
    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    {
      products(filter: {category_id: {eq: "{{cat_id}}"}}, sort: {relevance: ASC}) {
        total_count
        items {
          name
          sku
        }
      }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
1. Check the response.
1. Change the sort order from **ASC** to **DESC** in the GraphQL query:
    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    {
      products(filter: {category_id: {eq: "{{cat_id}}"}}, sort: {relevance: DESC}) {
        total_count
        items {
          name
          sku
        }
      }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
1. Check the response.

<ins>Expected results</ins>:

The product listing in the GraphQL response should be changed according to the sort order.

The sort order remains unchanged.

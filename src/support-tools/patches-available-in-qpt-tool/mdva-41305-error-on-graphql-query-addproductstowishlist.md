## Issue

When users add configurable products (with/without configuration) to the Wishlist by GraphQL, they are unable to get configurable SKUs and configurable options in response.

<ins>Steps to reproduce</ins>:

1. Create a configurable product (with Blue, Grey, and one custom option).
1. Open frontend; log in as a customer and create a Wishlist (check wishlist_id).
1. Open postman and create a customer token:

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation {
      generateCustomerToken(email: "", password: "") {
        token
      }
     }
     </code>
     </pre>

1. Set this token for Bearer Authorization.
1. Try to add a configurable product *Blue* to the wishlist using the following instructions:

<pre>
<code class="language-graphql">
mutation {
 addProductsToWishlist(
   wishlistId: 1
   wishlistItems: [
     {
       sku: "conf2"
       selected_options: [
            "Y29uZmlndXJhYmxlLzkzLzUw"
       ]
       quantity: 1
       entered_options: [
         {
           uid: "Y3VzdG9tLW9wdGlvbi8x"
           value: "test"
         }
       ]
     }
    ]
  ) {
    wishlist {
      id
      items_count
      items_v2 (currentPage: 1, pageSize: 8 ) {
        items {
         id
         quantity
         ... on ConfigurableWishlistItem  {
           child_sku
           customizable_options {
             customizable_option_uid
           }
         }
         product {
           uid
           name
           sku
           options_container
           ... on CustomizableProductInterface {
             options {
              title
              required
              sort_order
              option_id
              ... on CustomizableFieldOption {
                value {
                  uid
                  sku
                  price
                  price_type
                  max_characters
                }
              }
            }
          }
          price_range {
            minimum_price {
              regular_price {
                currency
                value
              }
            }
            maximum_price {
               regular_price {
                 currency
                 value
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
  user_errors {

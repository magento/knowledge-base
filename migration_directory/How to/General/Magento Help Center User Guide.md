<h2 id="what-is">WHAT IS MAGENTO HELP CENTER?</h2>

Welcome to Magento Help Center! We are here to help solving your Magento issues, and we are doing the best we can.

Magento Help Center is the [Knowledge Base](#kb) and the [Ticketing System](#support-tickets). This document shows how to use both of them.

<h2 id="login">LOG IN TO HELP CENTER</h2>

Click __Log&nbsp;in__&nbsp;in the upper-right corner.

<img alt="hc_log-in.png" height="223" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360001404034/hc_log-in.png" width="351"/>

Use your __Magento Account__ info to log in. For more information, see [Your Magento Account](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/magento/magento-account.html) (Magento User Guide).

Logging in allows you to work with [support tickets](#support-tickets). You can access all articles in the Magento Knowledge Base without logging in.

<h2 id="kb">KNOWLEDGE BASE</h2>

When you access the Help Center, you first get to the Magento Knowledge Base.

<h3 id="what-is-kb">What is Knowledge Base?</h3>

The Magento Support Knowledge Base is a collection of articles based on the support tickets that Magento Customers or Partners submit.

Every Knowledge Base article covers a real-life issue or question and may be viewed as a reply to a submitted support ticket helping others to solve a similar problem.

<h3 id="kb-devdocs-user-guide">Knowledge Base does not replace DevDocs or User Guide</h3>

The information in the Knowledge Base is designed as complementary to [DevDocs](http://devdocs.magento.com/), the [User Guide](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/getting-started.html), and [other Magento publications](https://magento.com/resources/technical), and only covers troubleshooting, answers FAQ's or highlights specific scenarios that have not been mentioned (for any reason)&nbsp;in the official documentation.

<h3 id="search-for-articles">Search for articles</h3>

<ol><li>In the <strong>Search</strong> field, start entering the keywords that an article should have. <br/>For example, <em>Redis</em>, <em>error</em>, <em>configuration management</em>, etc.<br/><br/><img alt="hc_search.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360001299274/hc_search.png"/><br/><br/>
</li><li>The top article suggestions are displayed below the <strong>Search</strong> field.</li><li>Select an article from the list and click it.<br/><br/><img alt="hc_top-article-suggestions.png" height="192" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360001301254/hc_top-article-suggestions.png" width="192"/>
</li><li>If you want the results of your search to be displayed on a new page:
<ul>
<li>Do not select an article from the suggestion list</li>
<li>After typing your search query, press Enter on your keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</li></ol>

The search&nbsp;is not limited to the article title but&nbsp;also includes the article text; the most relevant matches are displayed first.

You can find the __Search__ field on any page of the Knowledge Base. However, the suggestions are only displayed if you search from the Help Center's start page.

<h3 id="navigate-articles">Navigate articles using Categories</h3>

All articles in the Knowledge Base are grouped into Categories. They are:

*   __Troubleshooting:__ articles that show how to solve a particular issue.   
    For example, if you cannot perform an operation because of an error message, this is where you might find the solution.  
      
    
*   __How to:__ articles with detailed steps on how to perform a particular operation.  
      
    
*   __FAQ:__ answers to the most common, frequently asked questions.

To find articles through navigating the categories, follow these steps:

<ol><li>On the Help Center starting page, select an article category and click it.<br/><br/><img alt="hc_select-category.png" height="119" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360001284433/hc_select-category.png" width="506"/>
</li><li>The list of all articles in that category is displayed. Browse through the articles, find the one you need, then click it.<br/><br/><img alt="hc_troubleshooting.png" height="178" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360001301614/hc_troubleshooting.png" width="423"/>
</li></ol>

<h3 id="rate-articles">Rate articles</h3>

You may help us improve our articles let us know your opinion. At the bottom of every article, click __Yes__ or __No__ to answer the question __Was this article helpful?__

<img alt="hc_rate-article.png" height="97" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360001285353/hc_rate-article.png" width="182"/>

Please vote, your opinion matters!

<h2 id="support-tickets">SUPPORT TICKETS</h2>

Magento Ticketing System allows working with support tickets to address the particular issues you are experiencing while working with Magento — both Magento Commerce and Magento Commerce (Cloud).

<h3 id="track-tickets">Track your tickets</h3>

In your reply, you may specify additional technical details of your issue, provide escalation details, or state if the solution, offered by Magento Support, has proved helpful for your issue.

Magento Support has provided a solution for your issue, and you have agreed it has been helpful.

<h2 id="shared-access">SHARED ACCESS: GRANT PRIVILEGES FOR OTHER USERS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>

You may grant limited access to your account for other Magento account holders. In particular, using the __shared access__&nbsp;functionality, you may provide privileges for trusted employees and service providers to use your Help Center account&nbsp;so that they could work with your support tickets.

You can provide and manage shared access using your Magento Account page at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://account.magento.com/" rel="nofollow">https://account.magento.com</a>.

<h3 id="who-can-provide-shared-access">Who can provide shared access</h3>

Only the Account Owner (Primary Account Holder) with the according privileges can provide shared access for other users.

Managing users and their access is the customer's responsibility, especially in the shared access perspective.&nbsp;Thus, the Magento Support Team cannot provide shared access to a Magento account on behalf of a Customer. Customers are encouraged to add users with shared access themselves, using the&nbsp;[Magento Account page](https://account.magento.com/).

Users who have been provided with shared access cannot transfer or grant such access to other users.

<h3 id="find-account-owner-cloud">Get to know Account Owner (Cloud)</h3>

To find out who is the Owner of your Magento Commerce (Cloud) Account, follow these steps:

1.   Access your Magento Commerce (Cloud) [Project Web Interface](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/project/projects.html).
2.   Click the gear icon (Configure Project) next to your Project Name (upper-left corner).
3.   Go to the __Users__ tab.

&nbsp;

If, for any reason, the steps above are not applicable to you, and you are still not sure who your Account Owner is, contact your Magento Customer Success Manager (CSM).

<h3 id="provide-shared-access">Provide shared access</h3>

See the [Sharing Your Account](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/magento/magento-account-share.html) section of Magento User Guide for detailed steps on setting up a shared account.

After providing shared access for a new user, the related information is available in __Shared Access__ &gt; __Manage Permissions__ of your Magento Account page.

<img alt="magento-account-shared-manage-permissions.png" height="486" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360003178213/magento-account-shared-manage-permissions.png" width="600"/>

4.   Click __Delete This User__ at the bottom of the page.
5.   In the confirmation popup, click __Delete User__ to revoke access or X in the top corner to cancel revoking.

<span class="wysiwyg-color-red">__Problem:__</span> You want to provide shared access to your trusted colleague but you cannot locate the __Shared Access__ tab on your Magento Account page.

<span class="wysiwyg-color-orange120">__Possible cause:__</span> Permissions, necessary to grant shared access, have not been associated with your Magento Account.

<span class="wysiwyg-color-green120">__Solution:__</span> Contact your Magento Customer Success Manager. Please specify your name and the email, associated with your Magento Account.

#### <span class="wysiwyg-color-orange120">I use shared access but still see my tickets instead of the shared ones</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-color-red">__Problem:__</span> I'm accessing Help Center using shared access but still see only the tickets belonging to my own account (organization). The Magento Account page shows I'm using the account of the organization that has provided shared access for me, but the organization tickets are still not showing.

<span class="wysiwyg-color-orange120">__Possible cause:__</span> Your browser is using the cached content from the Help Center.
